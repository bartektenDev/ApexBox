Introducing ApexBox. 

The first software designed to improve you quality of life with your mailbox. 

Not much info I can say, but I can show you the code of this smart mailbox I've been working on.

Working:
-Webapp of ApexBox (GUI)
-Login page (ready)
-Dashboard page (basic design ready)
-Settings page (works, but could use more)
-Camera functions in webapp!

TO BE ADDED:
-Lock/Unlock mailbox 
(MUST WORK WITH HARDWARE THAT USER CAN ALSO UNLOCK WITH KEY IN CASE TECH FAILS)
-ON/OFF Outside mailbox light
-ON/OFF Interior mailbox light
-Add a settings feature to allow user to add (up to 5) email addresses to notify when mail has been delivered
-Setup app (mailbox will ONLY function if its connected to internet first) webapp will deploy from raspberry pi,
but not let user continue until the completed basic set up steps (internet, lock/unlock times
-Connect to ApexBox mail servers
